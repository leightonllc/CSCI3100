## Project Abstract

Our goal of this project is to develop a web-based application that helps CUHK students, lecturers and TAs to facilitate learning activities. The core feature of our application is timetable and calendar, also with other features, such as chatroom, forum, course evaluation and video streaming. We expect that students can manage their studies mainly using our web app.

We are going to build an application that helps students to manage all the daily problems and issues on the same website. 

## Features in Progress

- Course Evaluation
  - This application enables students to rate and comment on the courses which they have taken for the reference of other students interested in the courses.

- Forum
  - This application provides a platform for students to discuss their studies or school life.

- Timetable planner & calendar
  - This application lets students plan their timetable for the coming semester. All the courses can be selected in the application directly. Then, they can insert their course timetable in the calendar embedded.


## Implementation Details

The application is built with Vue.js, which is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. We also have MongoDB Altas as the backend; credentials in `backend/config.env`

Please have node.js installed before working on the project.
